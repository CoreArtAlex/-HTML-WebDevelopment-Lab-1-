    <BODY>
        <P> Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo’s certainly had </P>
        <P> the upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they </P>
        <P> pounded the ground in unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how,</P>
        <P> in these circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched. Michael’s fought point</P>
        <P> for point against a Leo’s team whose defence was almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan</P>
        <P> managed to hit home some impressive spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found</P>
        <P> themselves unable to finish the job and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a 25-22 win in</P>
        <P> the first set under their belt.</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> This is where it all went wrong for Claremorris. Having lost the first set, their nerves took over </P>
        <P> and their difficulty settling into the match was evident in a plethora of unforced errors, despite </P>
        <P> excellent positioning by Nikki Hanley and impact substitutions by Lisa McGreal and Jackie </P>
        <P> Prendergast. They lost the second set 25-19 and hope began to fade for their 200+ supporters</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> The third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had nothing to lose – except of</P>
        <P> course the All-Ireland Title – the team lifted their game tremendously, aided by the now</P>
        <P> deafening cries of their desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes. Strategic use</P>
        <P> of time outs by coach Fionnghuala King saw the girls finally settle into the match. She no doubt</P>
        <P> reminded them of their team mantra – no matter how badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose</P>
        <P> your marbles’. Stephanie Mellet had a great run of serves and made a stunning save at this</P>
        <P> crucial point in the set. Aisling Croghan made some unbelievable hits from the wings and Edel</P>
        <P> Nolan shone as the driving force behind Mount St Michael’s incredible comeback. They won the</P>
        <P> third set 25-16 and St Leo’s game began to fall apart.</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> A fear of losing now defined their play, and they frequently only used two of their three hits,</P>
        <P> eager to simply get the ball across the net. Meanwhile, Claremorris grew in confidence, scoring</P>
        <P> a resounding victory in the fourth set 25-13.</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> As it finally dawned that Claremorris could actually win this match, the excitement and tension</P>
        <P> in the arena reached fever pitch, and the daddies on the sideline (Gerry Croghan & Con Nolan)</P>
        <P> riled up the crowd, ably assisted by vice-principal Margaret Burke. However, St Leo’s finally </P>
        <P> realised that it was still all to play for and once again their defence, led by Sinead Ruth, became </P>
        <P> near-impossible to break down. Edel Nolan made three excellent spikes in a row only to find</P>
        <P> each and every one returned. Long rallies defined the 5th and final set (first to 15 points but the</P>
        <P> team must win by 2 points) and every time Claremorris inched ahead St Leo’s reeled them in</P>
        <P> again. Finally, however, they reached 14 – 13 and faced their first match point. Sinead Croghan,</P>
        <P> whose strength was such a defining feature of her play up to this point, unfortunately hit the</P>
        <P> serve long and it was back to stalemate. Two more match points followed, but Mount St</P>
        <P> Michael couldn’t seem to finish Leo’s off. At last, with 2 sets all and 17-16 on the scoreboard,</P>
        <P> Nikki Hanley served, raced forward to set the ball and Edel Nolan spiked the girls to the</P>
        <P> sweetest victory of their lives. No wonder, then, she was named Most Valuable Player of the</P>
        <P> match.</P>
        <P> </P>
        <P> Final score = St Leo’s v’s Mount Saint Michae</P>
        <P> 25-22, 25-19, 16-25, 13-25, 16-18</P>
